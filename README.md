# ZBRO
Yeah man, gonna print labels n stuff.

## Using

1. Install NodeJS and npm.
2. Clone this repository
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
   $ cd ~/Downloads/zbro-print-relay # or where your folder is
   $ npm i
```
4. Run:
```bash
   $ npm run start
```

## Things that are broken
1. There is no template for labels or anything. See if you can figure that out Ray.
2. No clue if all of the interfaces are setup correctly. You might have to look at the raw JSON document itself.



## Libraries
* CUPS Library: [node-printer](https://github.com/thiagoelg/node-printer) (idk if it works or not)
* Backend library: NestJS
